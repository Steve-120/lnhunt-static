    <p>A celebration was taking place in the city when I arrived. I didn't quite understand what it was about, though; something about a "heather week"?</p>
<p>A curious fact I figured out about my destination today: it's just under 7% of the way from Prague to Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>As I was arriving at my next destination, I met two gentlemen who were departing for another city about 150 kilometers to the west.</p>
<p>Didn't I <em>just</em> see the name of this city in an anime I was watching this season? The green haired girl told the lady who punches people it was her real name.</p>
<p>I arrived just in time for a home game and got to see the Fightin' Blasters in action. Update: I've been informed that's not the team's nickname.</p>
<p>I didn't know much about this place I arrived in. I looked it up on Wiki, and it said it was known for producing agricultural products, clothing and cattle.</p>
<p>I saw a giant fish statue as I arrived at today's city. I asked a local what it was called, and they told me it was called "The Fish". Gee, thanks.</p>
<p>I saw this next place is twin towns with Christchurch! But wouldn't you know, it was a different Christchurch; it's "once removed" from the New Zealand one.</p>
<p>I thought the tour guide was going to show me the Guru of Time! But no, that's just the name of the municipality's administrative seat.</p>
<p>I thought this city's name meant crab in the local language, but apparently it's written differently. Tomorrow I'll head back to my starting city and complete my tour, and then maybe I can figure out these extra things I picked up along the way.</p>
<p>I took a visit to the Buzwagi Gold Mine shortly after I arrived at today's town.</p>
<p>I was able to see a fossil of a man covered in calcite! I got to try some of the local bread too, which the city is also famous for.</p>
<p>I was inspired to write another cryptic clue today: "Endless donations" rejected, securing the Spanish revolutionary (5)</p>
<p>I've been thinking of trying my hand at writing cryptic clues. Here's one I came up with today: Blended orange municipality (6)</p>
<p>Maybe it was a mistake taking a train to my next city; it didn't depart until 3:10!</p>
<p>My next destination is the birthplace of one of my favorite comedians! Inspired by that, this morning I ordered my coffee covered in bees.</p>
<p>Now almost 2/3 of the way through my tour, I visited a world capital whose name reminded me of a BIG member of Hololive.</p>
<p>On my way to the next destination, I thought up yet another cryptic clue: City I'm almost in! (4)</p>
<p>On the tour I took today, I learned that this city's name means "sail" in the official language.</p>
<p>The town I arrived at today was just over 5/12 of the way from Tehran to Hamburg.</p>
<p>There wasn't much to do on the first day of the tour; I'll start traveling to other cities tomorrow, one per day, but for today I guess I can sneak in a quick trip to one of the local sights. I always wanted to visit an Inari shrine, and one of the biggest is here!</p>
<p>This city hosted the Winter Olympics! Never a yacht knee, as the locals say! (I think?)</p>
<p>This place (municipality, I think it's called?) is huge! It's 12.8% of its state by area, which is in turn 14.7% of its country by area, which is in turn 47.7% of its continent by area.</p>
<p>This place shares a name with someone from my favorite group of female mangaka! Update: wait, what do you mean she dropped it from her pen name??</p>
<p>This town is almost exactly 1/3 of the way from London to Wrocław.</p>
<p>Today I ended up in a city that's about 57.4% of the way from New Orleans to Amarillo.</p>
<p>When I saw this city's name, I thought of crocodiles. I realize that says more about my weeb nature than the city.</p>
<p>While I was looking through some old memes today en route to the next city, a very silly idea entered my head and I had to make this: (see image on right) <a href="../static/puzzle_resources/around-the-world/image.png"><img src="../static/puzzle_resources/around-the-world/image.png" width=25%></a><h4>Extra Thing Locations:</h4></p>
