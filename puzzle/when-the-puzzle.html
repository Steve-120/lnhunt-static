    <ul>
<li>
<p>You see, it's funny because he has hyperspecific opinions about water, such as liking this beginner-friendly bottled water brand. (5/8)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You see, it's funny because he's willing to be lowered into a pit of lava just to get this monster card back. (5/5)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You see, it's funny because this name is made up of two components that sound like English words, but other people still mispronounce it. (2/7)</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>You see, it's funny because this item increases accuracy but decreases his style. (2/10)</p>

<li>
<p>You see, it's funny because while the villain is in a fight with this hero, he gets insecure with his minion. (9 9/9) </p>
