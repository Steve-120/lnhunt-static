    <p>We are presented with an alphabetized list of 28 short journal-style entries, followed by a list of latitude/longitude locations of 14 “extra things”. The journal entries each clue a town/city/municipality somewhere in the world, and we start by solving the clues. Some are ambiguous initially, but most can be tackled immediately, and are a mix of language clues, pop culture references (mostly skewing weebish), local trivia clues (all Googleable), a few cryptic clues, some geographic calculations, and one very silly picture</p>

<p>The first two tools at <a href="https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html">this link</a> can be very helpful for figuring out the clues relating to locations between two cities: the first tool establishes the bearing and distance from the first city of the clue to the second, and then the first city, bearing, and proportional distance can be entered into the second tool to find the specified location between the two cities.</p>
<p>We eventually notice two patterns about the answers to the clues. First, the countries of the answers appear twice each. But maybe even more striking, for each answer, there exists a second answer that differs from the first by changing one letter. These observations can help in clue solving, for example suggesting Dutch or Swahili for the languages of Ede or Tanga’s clues, or helping lock in the answers to the cryptic clues.</p>
<p>The puzzle’s title and the clues for Kasama and Kani suggest that we are traveling from city to city on a multi-day tour around the world, then returning to the first city as our 29th “step”, and indeed, by starting at Kasama (whose clue mentions being the first day of the tour) and alternating between the city differing by one letter and the city in the same country, we visit all 28 clued cities and end in Kani (whose clue mentions that the next stop will be the first city again, meaning it’s the last). The order is specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kasama, Japan</li>
<li>Kahama, Tanzania</li>
<li>Tanga, Tanzania</li>
<li>Tanza, Philippines</li>
<li>Gerona, Philippines</li>
<li>Verona, Italy</li>
<li>Altamura, Italy</li>
<li>Altamira, Brazil</li>
<li>Jaraguá, Brazil</li>
<li>Baraguá, Cuba</li>
<li>Mella, Cuba</li>
<li>Melle, Germany</li>
<li>Aalen, Germany</li>
<li>Allen, USA</li>
<li>Yuma, USA</li>
<li>Yima, China</li>
<li>Sanya, China</li>
<li>Sanaa, Yemen</li>
<li>Aden, Yemen</li>
<li>Uden, Netherlands</li>
<li>Ede, Netherlands</li>
<li>Epe, Nigeria</li>
<li>Apapa, Nigeria</li>
<li>Anapa, Russia</li>
<li>Sochi, Russia</li>
<li>Kochi, India</li>
<li>Wani, India</li>
<li>Kani, Japan</li>
<li>Kasama, Japan</li>
</ul>
<p>With the cities placed in a cycle, we can finally turn our attention to the Extra Thing Locations. In fact, each of these locations lies on the straight path between a pair of cities that are one letter off. Making a copy of the Google Maps link can help with this realization, since it already has the Extra Thing Locations entered into it, and we can enter our clue cities and connect them via a straight line to see that an Extra Thing Location lies between them. Note that “straight line” paths on a globe generally do not look straight on map projections, but both the tool linked above and Google Maps take this into account. This aha can be deduced after noticing the pairs of cities off by one letter, and can be used in “backsolving” clues by extending a path from a city through an unused Extra Thing Location to look for other cities that are off by a letter.</p>
<p>The “between two cities”-style clues for individual cities hopefully let us think of the previous aha fairly easily, as well as this next one: we should look at what proportion of the way the Extra Thing Location is from one city to another along the path. For example, 31° 54′ 29″ N, 093° 22′ 42″ E is on the straight path from Kasama, Japan to Kahama, Tanzania, and it is specifically 4/11 of the way from Kasama to Kahama. The last aha is that Kasama and Kahama differ by changing S to H, which is a shift of 11 places in the alphabet. So the Extra Thing along this path is the letter that’s 4/11 of the way from S to H, which is O.</p>

    <p>Seven weeks ago, someone sent me a meme image on discord:</p>
<p><img src="../static/puzzle_resources/around-the-world/meme.webp" width=33%></p>
<p>I saw it and instantly thought it should be a puzzle, and what you see now is how that idea came to fruition. I eventually tracked down the image to what I believe to be its source: <a href="https://x.com/UndeniablyAlex/status/1517206009474949121">https://x.com/UndeniablyAlex/status/1517206009474949121</a></p>
<p>Someone told me my clues were “avant-garde”, and all I can say is that this is how my brain works.</p>
