<p>We are presented with statements and a lot of question marks. As the title suggests, these statements are not exactly accurate, and we can pedantically correct them.</p>
<p>This puzzle is a parody of the Dropout show <em>Um, Actually!</em>, where contestants are asked to correct the given prompts by preceding their corrections with the phrase “Um, actually”. For this puzzle, we use “Erm, actually”, and this phrase matches the first question marks of each prompt, meaning we are expected to fill in enough of the intended correction to extract the letter that would fit in the underscore. The words were chosen to be important to the correction and so that it should be possible to determine what the missing letter is without necessarily being sure of the entire rest of the sentence. Reading the missing letters in the provided prompt order gives “ANS RATTLESNAKE”, meaning the final answer is just <strong>RATTLESNAKE</strong>.</p>
<p>In order, the prompts and their corrections are (with the relevant corrections bolded):</p>
<p>In the video game Celeste, you control Celeste as she climbs to the top of a mountain, meeting other characters such as Theo and Mr. Oshiro along the way.<br><span class="mono">Erm, actually, you control Madeline. Celeste is the name of the <b>mount<u>a</u>in</b>.</span></p>
<p>Stokes' theorem is an important theorem in calculus that relates line integrals to surface integrals. However, it is also a classic example of Stigler's law of eponymy, as George Stokes never got to prove the theorem, but he is still credited for its name for being the first to state it.<br><span class="mono">Erm, actually, <b>Lord Kelvi<u>n</u></b> was the first to state the theorem.</span></p>
<p>In Galaxy Quest, Tim Allen plays Peter Quincy Taggart, the has-been star actor of the titular Star Trek-like TV show. When he's invited by real aliens to captain a working replica of the show's ship to save their species from extinction, he has to step up and work together with his former colleagues, played by actors including Alan Rickman, Sigourney Weaver, and Sam Rockwell.<br><span class="mono">Erm, actually, Tim Allen plays <b>Ja<u>s</u>on Nesmith</b>. Peter Quincy Taggart is the name of the character played by Nesmith in the in-universe Galaxy Quest TV show.</span></p>
<p>Dragon Ball Z is an influential anime series that started airing 1989. Based on a manga created by Akira Toriyama, it features not only the most iconic characters in anime but also the most powerful transformations such as Mystic Gohan and Ultra Instinct Goku.<br><span class="mono">Erm, actually, Ultra Instinct Goku is in Dragon Ball <b>Supe<u>r</u></b>, not Dragon Ball Z.</span></p>
<p>The beatmania IIDX series is one of the longest running franchises of rhythm games in the world. Its 33rd arcade release, titled Sparkle Shower, includes licensed songs by Hoshimachi Suisei and OSTER project, original songs by commissioned artists such as xi and Nhato, and also original songs by Konami employees like dj TAKA and DJ YOSHITAKA.<br><span class="mono">Erm, actually, Sparkle Shower is the <b>thirty-fourth</b> arcade release, because beatmania IIDX <b>Substre<u>a</u>m</b> was not numbered.</span></p>
<p>In The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, the player must first collect three Spiritual Stones and learn the Song of Time in order to open the Door of Time in the Temple of Time. After obtaining the Master Sword and awakening as the Hero of Time, the player must then collect six medallions that are each obtained after defeating the boss of the corresponding Temple. After obtaining the six medallions, the player can finally activate the rainbow bridge leading into Ganon's Castle and challenge the final boss.<br><span class="mono">Erm, actually, the <b>Ligh<u>t</u> Medallion</b> is automatically given to the player after becoming the Hero of Time, not after defeating a boss.</span></p>
<p>Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc's signature "high schoolers murdering each other" starts after several students wake up in a locked-up school. To introduce the rules, Monokuma announces one can graduate from the school by killing someone else (thereby becoming the "blackened") and successfully evading discovery during the resulting class trial.<br><span class="mono">Erm, actually, class trials are announced <b>af<u>t</u>er</b> the first murder.</span></p>
<p>In Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, Reimu sets out to find the source of the scarlet mist, which they find to be the Scarlet Devil Mansion on the banks of the Misty Lake (which hosts fairies like Cirno).<br><span class="mono">Erm, actually, in Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, the Scarlet Devil Mansion is on an <b>is<u>l</u>and in the middle</b> of the Misty Lake.</span></p>
<p>The props in the background of the set of Um, Actually are all references to famous media franchises, but with something wrong with them. Examples of such "mistaken" props include cubical Poké Balls, a Vulcan salute spreading the wrong two fingers, the Simpsons fish Blinky with three eyes, a Settlers of Catan board missing its desert, and a license plate from Ghostbusters reading ECTO-ONE.<br><span class="mono">Erm, actually, Blinky is supposed to have <b>thre<u>e</u></b> eyes. The version on Um, Actually only has <b>two</b> eyes.</span></p>
<p>Bocchi the Rock! features the main characters Hitori Gotoh, Ryou Yamada, Nijika Ijichi, and Ikuyo Kita, a group of high schoolers who go on to perform together as Kessoku Band. Their family names are derived from an actual Japanese band Asian Kung-Fu Generation, mirroring their band roles as well.<br><span class="mono">Erm, actually, Masafumi Gotoh is ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's <b>lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist</b>, a role played by Ikuyo Kita. Meanwhile, Kensuke Kita is the <b>lead guitari<u>s</u>t</b>, a role played by Hitori Gotoh.</span></p>
<p>Anime studio Kyoto Animation has produced anime series adapting many other Japanese media properties, including many light novels. Some, such as Beyond the Boundary and Violet Evergarden, adapt light novels the studio itself has published, whereas others, like The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Hyouka, and Amagi Brilliant Park, adapt light novels published by Kadokawa Shoten or Fujimi Shobo.<br><span class="mono">Erm, actually, Hyouka is not based on a <b>light novel</b>, it's based on a <b><u>n</u>ovel</b>.</span></p>
<p>Yanagi Nagi is a Japanese singer, famous for singing anime themes such as Yukitoki for Oregairu and over and over for Just Because! She was also a guest vocalist of Supercell for a while, and in that period, she sang anime themes such as Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari for Bakemonogatari and My Dearest for Guilty Crown.<br><span class="mono">Erm, actually, Supercell's guest vocalist for My Dearest is <b>Koed<u>a</u></b>.</span></p>
<p>One common theme among the films directed by Studio Ghibli's Hayao Miyazaki is a pervasive anti-war sentiment. Being the son of the director of Miyazaki Airplane, a company which manufactured parts for Japanese fighter planes during World War II, Hayao Miyazaki's complex feelings about war are frequently on display on some of his most thought-provoking films, such as Grave of the Fireflies, Porco Rosso, and The Wind Rises.<br><span class="mono">Erm, actually, Grave of the Fireflies was directed by <b>Isao Ta<u>k</u>ahata</b>, not Hayao Miyazaki.</span></p>
<p>A key electrical component in buildings is a circuit breaker, which provides safety against an excess in voltage that may cause damage to the electrical circuit and equipment. Circuit breakers are reusable, as opposed to fuses that melt after preventing damage once.<br><span class="mono">Erm, actually, circuit breakers and fuses protect against an excess in <b>curr<u>e</u>nt</b>, not voltage.</span></p>

    
    
    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    <p>Idontknow: For some reason I have acquired a slight reputation for being the guy to ask about Touhou trivia in puzzlehunt contexts for my team. This is still a blatantly disproportionate reputation because I just ask my brother, who I will now prove exists:</p>
<p>adfun12345: Hi it's me adfun12345 also known as Idontknow's brother.
I exist guys I swear.</p>
<p>Idontknow: Also it’s his first puzzle authorship credit.</p>
<p>kt3: This was the last-written puzzle for this hunt. It had been reserved for a long time as the dedicated replacement puzzle because it would be easy to write. Some buffs were considered, but we ultimately decided on this simple implementation. On another note, we are aware that ChatGPT obliterates this puzzle, but we trust solvers to do what they feel will give them the most enjoyable experience.</p>
