    <p>We are presented with nine complicated diagrams made of circles, boxes, and arrows, each with an associated clue. These diagrams each correspond to a piece of media with a non-linear narrative – the circles are arranged chronologically from left to right, but they are actually presented following the order of the arrows within the work itself.</p>
<p>Our first step is to identify these pieces of media from the diagrams, and solve the corresponding clues. To aid with identification, the diagrams are given in alphabetical order of the works they represent, and the Circles section tells us what the circles in each diagram represent, in some order. The answers to the clues are all in reference to the first circle, identified with START HERE.</p>
<table>

<th>Identifying features</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Ace Attorney</td>
<td>Game episode</td>
<td>Mia Fey</td>
<td>Circles all collected into boxes with 4 to 6 (representing individual games). Portion that takes place way far back in the past (representing The Great Ace Attorney).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cloud Atlas</td>
<td>Novel Chapter</td>
<td>Chatham Islands</td>
<td>Order that goes strictly forwards in time, then strictly backwards. The chapters in the backwards portion of the narrative immediately follow where the forwards ones left off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Galactic Puzzle Hunt</td>
<td>Annual Event</td>
<td>Brown Herrings</td>
<td>Order that is mostly chronological, with bidirectional “branches” into a single other event. Likely hard to identify without prior knowledge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marvel Cinematic Universe</td>
<td>Movie</td>
<td>Paramount Pictures</td>
<td>Very large number of ungrouped circles. Mostly equally spaced gaps with two big outliers at the left (representing the Captain America and Captain Marvel films)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Metal Gear</td>
<td>Mainline Video Game</td>
<td>Ultra Games</td>
<td>Long chronological stretch at the start. Two circles that immediately follow each other (representing Peace Walker and Ground Zeroes). Most likely identified through lists of non-linear narratives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Monogatari</td>
<td>Anime arc</td>
<td>NISIOISIN</td>
<td>Large number of boxes with different numbers of circles (representing anime seasons). Multiple instances of concurrent events, shown by circles with the same horizontal alignment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Princess Principal</td>
<td>Anime episode</td>
<td>Cavorite</td>
<td>Very specific ordering with few patterns. Likely very hard to identify without consulting lists of non-linear narratives and using process of elimination from other diagrams.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pulp Fiction</td>
<td>Movie Part</td>
<td>Samuel L. Jackson</td>
<td>Many concurrent events, with some circles having just a bit of overlap. One circle split into two parts (representing “Prelude to ‘The Gold Watch’”)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Star Wars</td>
<td>Movie</td>
<td>Gary Kurtz</td>
<td>Circles split mostly into three groups of three that follow each other, in a Middle -&gt; Beginning -&gt; End order. Likely one of the easier break-ins due to the fame of the franchise as well as the relatively simple diagram.</td>

<p>Having solved most of the clues, we can proceed to the diagram at the bottom. Clued by the fact that it is rendered in the same way as the prior diagram, this is also in chronological order. Analyzing the works we identified, we can notice that multiple of them have a canonical time period where their first entry takes place:</p>
<ul>
<li>Galactic Puzzle Hunt 2017 took place in March 2017, simply enough.</li>
<li>The first trial in Ace Attorney takes place in August 2016. While the text presenting the date in-game only gives us a day and a month, the year can be inferred from the later information about the DL-6 incident, which takes place 15 years in the past in December 2001.</li>
<li>The first game in the Metal Gear series takes place in 1995. While this is not confirmed in the game itself, Metal Gear Solid, which takes place in early 2005, confirms that 10 years have passed since.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the other works do not have an exact canonical time period, we can make good enough estimates to be able to order them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Similarly to Ace Attorney and Metal Gear, we can infer the date in Iron Man by comparing it to other movies in the MCU that have canon dates. However, due to inconsistent continuity in the early films the best we can do is obtain a range from around 2008 to 2011.</li>
<li>Similarly to Ace Attorney, in the Monogatari series we only get information about days and months and not a year, but by using information about some dates that are known to fall on certain days of the week, we can narrow down the exact year to 2006. For instance, in the second arc of the Monogatari Series Second Season we learn the information that May 14th landed on a Sunday 11 years before the current year.</li>
<li>Making inferences from the technology and culture on display on each of them, we can place the start of Cloud Atlas around the middle of the 19th century, Princess Principal around the end of the 19th century and the start of the 20th, and Pulp Fiction around the early 90s at the latest, all of them before all our other identified items.</li>
<li>Finally, Star Wars is famously stated to take place “A long time ago”. Given that all of our other identified time periods are relatively contemporaneous, we can reasonably assume that it happened before all of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having an order, we can now place the works into the corresponding circles below, and index the number in each circle into the clues we solved earlier.</p>

<p>The answer is <strong>UMA MUSUME</strong>.</p>

    
    
    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    <p>The MCU diagram being outdated was simply because we have no idea what is happening in that franchise anymore. This puzzle used to have the answer of Obligatory Balatro Puzzle, but was later changed post-hiatus after the global release of Uma Musume: Pretty Derby. </p>
